**	If no service is listening at the target port,

**	If a service is listening, the operating system will silently drop

**	service at the port. However, since packets can be dropped accidentally

**	cause UDP packets that are sent too fast not to be processed by the
**	remote host. As a result of this, UDP port scanning is much slower
**	than TCP port scanning and by default probes only a small number of ports
